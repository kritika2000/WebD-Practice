The method attribute of the form element tells 
the browser how to send form data to a web server.

GET -> 
1. Specifying a value of GET means the browser 
will add the form contents to the end of the URL.
2. used in case of simple forms where security in not a concern.

POST-> 
1. data will be sent to the web server.
2. necessary for storing data in database.

"name" attribute is required in <input> if you want to send field values
back to the server on a form submission, it is sent with the form data
as name/value pair whereas "id" is used 
for basic DOM operations.
