Node JS is a JS runtime build over V8 Engine just like a web browser.
JS requires a context to run. In the browser, it is window. In node it is the global object.

Node JS provides a whole lot of modules/APIs, servers(eg:- http) to create full stack apps.

JS Engine -> executes JS code by converting it into machine understandable code.
JS Runtime -> provide tools(APIs, JS Engine etc) to run the JS code. For eg: browser, Node JS.

Commands:-
npm install ->  to install a modules
node filename/filename.js -> execute a file in Node JS.
