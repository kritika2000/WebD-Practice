        We add a form element with action attribute.
        action Attribute is used to specify where the form data is to be sent to the server 
        after the submission of the form.
        method attribute -> https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_form_method.asp#:~:text=The%20method%20attribute%20specifies%20how,URL%20in%20name%2Fvalue%20pairs

            label is used to decribe the form controls.

            control to label the control.

            input has a 

            type attribute which define what values it can take.

            id attribute which must match with the label.

            name attribute is for labelling the input data/text with the name
            specified by this attribute on the server.

            placeholder defines what to enter to help the user(Example data).

            autocomplete attribute accepts on/off values. ON means it will remember the 
            previous inputs and suggest those when entering a new value.

            autofocus -> only one form element can have autofocus because it can't focus
            more that one element at a time. It puts the focus in the input when the page loads.
