      <p>This is my first web page.</p>

      <!-- We add images using img tag and link(relative or absolute) to resource 
        using src attribute.

        alt attribute is used to describe the image when the image doesn't load 
        may be due to no internet connection etc. It is good for assistive technology,
        as the screen reader will read the alt attr text when the image is not displayed.

        can add title attribute but the text will not be read by screen readers
        but just be seen when someone hovers on the image. Not necessary to add.

        can add either height or width or both to the image. If we add only one attribute
        then the browser sets the height automatically to maintain tghe aspect ratio.
        It is now recommended to provide height and width though we can override these
        values by css. When we specifically add height and width to the tag, it tells the
        browser already how much space the image will take.
        Cumulative Layout Shift (or CLS) is a measure of how much a webpage unexpectedly shifts during its life.
        High CLS means bad performance. As, different resources(images, banners) load on different speeds and some may load
        after the whole page has loaded and can cause the content to shift depending on how 
        much space the resource would take.

        disable cache as the browsers know to load cached images after they're loaded
        for the first time.

      <!-- we can add a loading attribute whoch can have 2 values.
        1. eager(default) -> load the resources even if they're not seen currently as they
        are somewhere very below in the page and user needs to scroll down the page to see it.
        2. lazy -> load the resource only when the user is about to see the image as he's scrolled down
        the page. This is used to improve performance by loading the page faster.
        As it only loads images when needed.
        If the image is not seen but is near to the image downloaded already 
        chrome still load that image. As it loads images much earlier.

      <!-- 
        To give images a caption instead of using a <p> element
        we wrap our image inside figure tag and add a figcaption element
        inside the figure element along with img element.
        Using a paragraph may visually see as a caption to the image
        but it will not tell the assistive technology that the written content
        is a caption for the image.
        
        Figure element is not only for images we can use other elements inside figure
        along with figcaption. But it gives identation by default.
