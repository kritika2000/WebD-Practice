Problem:- 
In React, we can only pass data i.e. props and state downwards.
If two sibling components want to share data, the only possible ways is to
lift state-up.
But lifting state upto the top level elements and then passing data down 
is a tedious task.

Prop drilling is the process in a React app where props are passed 
from one part of a tree to another by going through other parts 
that do not need the data, but only help in passing it through the tree.

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree 
without having to pass down props manually.

We wrap the component, which is common to the components(Consumers) requiring 
same state/props, in a Provider and this Provider-Consumer pair allows to create
a context tunnel and we can pass data through this tunnel.
