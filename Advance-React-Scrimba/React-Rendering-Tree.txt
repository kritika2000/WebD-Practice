React render components recursively, i.e. it render the leftmost 
component at the bottom of the heirarchy first.

If any of the state changes occur at any given component, it rerenders the whole 
subtree or the components below it even if, the component hasn't passed 
down the state to its descendents.

This will be very inefficient if the state changes occur at the topmost component
which we're likely to do, as we lift state up so that it can be accessible to its
child components and holds a single source of truth.
