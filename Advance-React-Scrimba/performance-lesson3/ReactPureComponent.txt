Shallow Comparison -> Compare properties using '===' operator.
for primitives(say object) we can only shallow compare(===) the properties of two identical objects.
two objects can't be strictly equal but can be shallow equal.

React uses this concept for optimization.


Problem we're addressing -> 
Whenever state changes occur, react rerenders everything underneath it.

PureComponent:-
1. Alternative to React.Component
2. Automatically implements shouldComponentUpdate() for shallow comparisons.
3. Disallows using shouldComponentUpdate() manually.
4. Skips rerendering of all children in the tree automatically,
so they must be 'pure' components as well.
5. Generally preferred over implementing your own shouldComponentUpdate().
