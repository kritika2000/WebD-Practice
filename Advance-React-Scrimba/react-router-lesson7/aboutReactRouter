React Router is not officially a part of React.

It is considered a defect away to make single page applications in react.
Used to build multipage sites.

In multipage applications, the request goes to the server for every page
to render on the browser. The entire app is reloaded for the smallest change.

In SPAs with React, initially, the request goes to the server to load the entire app and if the user interacts with the app, the new data/view is shown via conditional rendering while keeping other components/content intact.

React Router:-

1. Conditionally renders large parts of our page.
2. It has a Declarative API i.e. we're given some hooks/components to
   handle switching things that we see on the page.
3. It comes with hooks and some components.

Primary Components:-

Routers - Browser, Hast Routers.
Route Matchers - Route, Switch.
Navigation - Link, NavLink, Redirect.

Hooks - useHistory, useLocation, useParam.
