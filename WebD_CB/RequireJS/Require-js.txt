To use ocm rest apis in your vbcs app first you need to download the oracle sdk.

Adding oracle sdk using define:
define function takes two parameters first a list of dependencies(oracle sdk in our case) the module depends on and 
second is a function which takes the object(OracleCEUI), as parameter, returned by the sdk module once it gets loaded.
For eg:

In your module, you can use OracleCEUI properties(like ssoInit, oceUrl etc).

OCM Rest Apis example:

1. Get home folder contents
2.Get a folder with specific folder id or guid.
3.Create a sub folder in a specific folder
4.upload a file to a folder.
