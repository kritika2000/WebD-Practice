RequireJS is a js file and a module/script loader. It packages all the js scripts in 
one file.

Use-case:
Easy to manage a lot of js files.
For eg: You have a lot of script files added in your html file
and you want to make changes in any one of those script files.

Why we load the js file two times(once in script tag where the require.js 
is loaded and next in require(['filename']))?

require.js script tag is an asynchronous call i.e. the js files will be loaded
simultaneously.
