Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects 
inherit features from one another.

__proto__ is a hidden variable(in every object) which 
points to the object from 
which the current object has inherited. or it points to 
the blue print from which it was created.

Prototypes are the blue print from which we create things.
String.Prototype(default blue print exists in JavaScript) is a template 
or blue print from which a string(str) is made

Classes in JavaScript still works the way Prototype does.

whenever we create an object of a class, the object will inherit 
from the classname.Prototype and the class will inherit from Object.Prototype
