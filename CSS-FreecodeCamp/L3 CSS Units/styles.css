    units determine the size of everything on your page.
    absolute units -> pc, px, pt -> we use px more often.

    We use absolute value when they doesn't depend on the window size of the device
    as they remain same on all type of devices.

    Relative units -> percentages(%), em ,rem, vh, vw etc;
    % -> are % of some another quantity.

    rem -> typically use to set the font size of the root element(html).
    1rem = 1 x font-size of the root element.

    em -> relative to it's parent font-size if not set on the element otherwise
    it will look at the element itself, typically used for setting margins and paddings.
    If we set the font-size on an element = 2em it means 2 x font size of the parent.
    But for paddings and margins we have padding: 2em -> 2 x font-size of the element 
    itself(if not set then look at the parent).

    vh -> 1% of viewport height
    vw -> 1% of viewport width.

    Better way is to use rem i.e. to look at the root element for font-size
    as using em the size will always dependent on the parent.
