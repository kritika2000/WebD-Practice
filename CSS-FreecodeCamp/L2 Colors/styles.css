        apply background color to body element.
        140 colors available.
        backgound: blue is a shorthand for background.
        It also allows us to set other background properties.
        
        We can use rgb() function to set the color. Every color is a proportion
        of some red, green and blue(0-255).
        Black -> rgb(0, 0, 0);
        White -> rgb(255, 255, 255);

        There is something called rgba, there is a alpha channel.
        This guides the transparency. It has values from 0-1.
        0 makes it most transparent and it becomes least transparent as we move
        up to 1.
