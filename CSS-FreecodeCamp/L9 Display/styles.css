/* 
    there are two types of elements:- block level and inline elements.
    
    block elements(div, p, h(1-6) etc):- take up the whole width of it's parent
    and starts on a new line. They respect margins and padding on all sides.
    Margin would cause othe relements to move away.

    inline elements(button, img, a span etc):- 
    do not take the whole width
    but take as much they need.
    do not cause a line break.
    height and width is not applied.
    horizontal margin and padding is applied cause the elements to move away.
    vertical margins and paddings are applied but do not the element to move away.
    In vertical paddings the element overlaps.

    display: none -> cause the element to remove from the DOM.
