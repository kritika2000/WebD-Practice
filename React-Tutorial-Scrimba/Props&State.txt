---------------- Props -----------------

Props refers to the properties being passes into a 
component in order for it to work correctly, similar to
how a function receive parameters.
A component receiving props is not allowed to modify 
those props as they're immutable.

function Navbar(props) {
    // not allowed.
    props.coverImage = "something else"
}
<Navbar coverImage="some-image2" />


--------------------- State -------------------

State refers to any values that're managed by the component, 
similar to variables declared inside a function.
Anytime you have changing values that should be saved/displayed
you'll likely be using states.

------------------------ Quiz ----------------------

1. How would you describe the concept of "state"?
A way for React to remember saved values from within a component.
This is similar to declaring variables from within a component,
with a few added bonuses (which we'll get to later)


2. When would you want to use props instead of state?
Anytime you want to pass data into a component so that
component can determine what will get displayed on the
screen.


3. When would you want to use state instead of props?
Anytime you want a component to maintain some values from
within the component. (And "remember" those values even
when React re-renders the component).


4. What does "immutable" mean? Are props immutable? Is state immutable?
Unchanging. Props are immutable. State is mutable.
