The controlled component is a way that you 
can handle the form input value using the state and 
to change the input value there is only one way to change 
it is using setState or useState if you are using React Hooks
and you can change this state using one of the events like onChange
and when the user starts writing any character setState or useState 
will be called and update the state of this input then it will add 
the new value inside the input.

The uncontrolled component is like traditional HTML 
form inputs that you will not be able to handle the value
by yourself but the DOM will take care of handling the 
value of the input and save it then you can get this value 
using React Ref and for example, print it inside alert when
submitting or play with this value as you want.
