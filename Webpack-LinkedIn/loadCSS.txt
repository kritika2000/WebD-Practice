We can load CSS, SASS with webpack.
The benefit of loading CSS as a module is that the webpack will
only bundle styles that our app uses.
We can require or import styles for use in certain files
and it will perform transformations on Sass and less 
to turn it into CSS.
In order to import and load CSS in a module, we need a 
loaded(style-loader, css-loader) ->  npm install style-loader css-loader --save-dependencies
For transformation add config in webpack.config.js file.
