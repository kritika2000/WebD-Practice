/**
 * Install webpack and webpack-cli
 *
 * Create config file for entry point and
 * name of bundle file -> Out of the box, webpack wonâ€™t
 * require you to use a configuration file.
 * However, it will assume the entry point
 * of your project is src/index.js and will output
 * the result in dist/main.js minified and optimized
 * for production.
 *
 * Create index.js file.
 *
 * Create and launch the bundle using "npx webpack --config ./webpack.config.js"
 * This will create a new /dist folder with main.js bundle file.
 *
 * add 'build' as webpack to scripts in pckg.json to use npm run build
 * cmd to run webpack command.
