Webpack loaders can perform transformation on files.
help load files and images.
For eg:- many react apps use JSX to create components
which can't be understood by the browser so it needs to 
be first converted to plain JS

Babel is the most common tool for this transformation.

When we use webpack we tell webpack to use babel to perform
these transformation on certail type of files.

Set up babel-loader:-

1. npm install babel-loader @babel/core --save-dev
  --babel loader is the loader and babel core is the 
  --actual package that handle transformations.
2. Add the below code to webpack.config.JS
  --module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/, -> whenever a js file is found babel should transpile it.
        exclude: /(node_modules)/, -> don't run babel on node_modules.
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader", -> use babel loader.
        },
      },
    ],
  },
3. To actually transform the code we need a preset(babel/preset-env).
